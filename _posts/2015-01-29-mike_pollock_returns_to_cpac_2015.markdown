"Mike Pollock is one of New York's premier voice actors.Saturday
morning cartoon enthusiasts might recognize him as Meat in
Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy, Garbageman in the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, or as both the Mayor and ""Samo"" the
bartender in Kirby: Right Back At Ya!.

Anime fans might recognize him as the narrator for Pokémon from
2003 to 2013, Adon in Beserk: The Golden Age Arc II, or as Neppo
in Welcome to the Space Show.

He has also voiced Dr. Eggman and Ella in Sonic X and the Sonic the
Hedgehog video games, Bigoriki in Gororiki, and Langston Lickatoad in
Viva Piñata. Other places he's been are Yu-Gi-Oh! GX as Bonaparte, and
the Marvel Motion comic adaptation of Astonishing X-Men as Beast.

Residing close to home here in the New York area, and having been a
guest of honor at CPAC previously in 2011, we are happy to welcome him
back again this year."
