<p><b>*Be sure to register as soon as you can! Cosplay Runway and Cosplay Exposition Registration will close on March 06st, 2013 at midnight or

<h1>Cosplay Runway</h1>
<p>So you spent all that time making your costume and you'd like to show it off, right? Well, here's
the place - you can show off your costume individually or as a group. Hong Kong Specials are discouraged, but we really can't stop you. <b>The costumes will not be officially judged, so you can keep cool.</b></p>

<h2>Cosplay Runway Rules</h2>
<li>The Castle Point Anime Convention is a family friendly event! Performances must be rated no higher than PG-13. This means no nudity and no excessive language!</li>

<li><b>In the Hall Cosplay event, you do not put on a skit.</b> We will introduce your character, and you may then walk onto the stage,
show off your costume (being in character is more than welcome, but not required!) and walk off.</li>

<h1>Cosplay Chess</h1>
<p>Ever feel like you were just some pawn in someone's master plan? Well, that was was probably just your imagination,
but this certainly will not be! Take your place on our human chess match and show off your character in cosplay chess. </p>

<h2>Cosplay Chess Rules</h2>
<li>All fighting in Cosplay Chess is pretending and acting! No use of excessive force is allowed.
No contact between players is preferred but very light contact will be permitted. Please be careful when using props!</li>
<li>Participation in Cosplay Chess assumes all participants are fully aware of any risks involved.
The Castle Point Anime Convention will not be held responsible if any injury is to occur during the event.</li>
<li>Registration for Cosplay Chess is on a first come first serve basis! Anyone who registers after all 32
player spots have been filled will be put on a waiting list. Those on a waiting list will replace players who do not show up for the event.</li>
<li>The pieces to be played are traditional chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn).We
will try to consider what pieces the player desires to be, but there is no guarantee on any specific position. Do not be deterred. Cosplay Chess will feature lots of action!</li>
<li>Make sure you are familiar with the Rules for All Cosplay Events and also with Convention Policy and Weapon Policy.</li>
<li>Be a good sport and have fun!</li><br />
