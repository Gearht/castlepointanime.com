<h1>CPAC Policies</h1>

<p><strong>ATTENTION: All CPAC staff will be wearing an official staff shirt
    and will be wearing a clearly visible staff badge with their name and
    photo on it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In case of injury or other emergency, follow all instructions of CPAC staff,
    convention officials, and police.</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to the Castle Point Anime Convention! Whether this is your first
    CPAC or your eight, there are some policies and guidelines we all must follow
    in order to keep the convention safe, sane, and fun.</p>

<p><em>Note: these policies must be followed by everybody. This includes attendees,
    artists, dealers, staff, security, etc. The rules may only be overridden by
    both the convention chair and vice-chair together or by the Stevens police at
    their discretion.</em></p>

<p>In general, make sure to use common sense, show respect to the other
    attendees and staff, and to avoid anything that might pose a danger to yourself
    or others. Keep in mind that the Stevens campus is private property, and the
    local campus police or administration may remove anybody from the convention at
    their discretion.</p>

<h2><a id="h.dz2kmmvczy96" name="h.dz2kmmvczy96"></a>General Policies</h2>

<p>Your admittance to CPAC is dependent upon you receiving a badge from
    registration and following these policies while anywhere on the Stevens campus
    or in Stevens building. <strong><em>You must wear your badge at all times at
    CPAC.</em></strong> Staff and security may ask you to present your badge before entering
    buildings or certain rooms (such as the dance).</p>

<p>Lost attendee badges will not be replaced, and must be purchased at full
    price. However, damaged badges and badge holders will be replaced at no charge;
    just bring your badge to registration.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>make sure to keep your bags and belongings with you</strong>. CPAC is not
    responsible for any damaged, lost, or stolen items while on Stevens campus.
    Make sure not to leave valuables unattended.</p>

<h2><a id="h.w17a2uopsmvv" name="h.w17a2uopsmvv"></a>Staying Safe: Disruptive
    Behavior</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Mind the flow of traffic and do not obstruct hallways.</strong> Restricted
        areas are off-limits to attendees and will be labeled with caution tape or
        signs.</li>

    <li>The convention grounds have many great opportunities for photographs.
        Please respect the grounds. <strong>Do not climb on statues or
        buildings.</strong> Always be aware that the convention grounds are in the
        middle of the city of Hoboken, and that there will be traffic nearby.</li>

    <li>CPAC is a family friendly event. Do not wear clothing that may be
        considered lewd or inappropriate in a public setting. <strong>No nudity or partial
        nudity is allowed.</strong> Also, no rude or profane clothing or signs are
        allowed on the convention grounds.</li>

    <li><strong>Smoking is not permitted in any of the convention buildings.</strong> While
        smoking is permitted outside the buildings, we ask that you respect those
        around you and dispose of the remnants appropriately.</li>

    <li><strong>Stay hydrated!</strong> CPAC may not be that big, but if you&rsquo;re
        standing or walking for a long time (especially in cosplay), it can become
        tiring. You can be dehydrated without feeling thirsty. Always drink more
        than you think you need.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="h.381htkpprvhk" name="h.381htkpprvhk"></a>Staying Safe: Children and
    Groups</h2>

<p>When traveling in groups or as a family (especially with children),
    establish a specific place where you will meet up if separated. A recommended
    meetup place is by the information desk, located in the first floor Babbio
    Atrium.</p>

<p>Small children should be accompanied by their parent or guardian at all
    times. <strong>Please take a minute</strong> to write emergency contact information on the
    back of your child&rsquo;s badge! <em>This is the best way for staff to contact you
    if your child is found.</em> If your child is missing, notify the nearest staff
    member or security.</p>

<h2><a id="h.rqztwfyyd96y" name="h.rqztwfyyd96y"></a>Staying Safe: Weapons
    Policy</h2>

<p><em>CPAC considers any device capable of causing injury, or being confused with
    an object capable of causing injury, a weapon.</em></p>

<p>To ensure a safe and fun environment, CPAC has strict restrictions on such
    devices within the convention grounds. The weapon restrictions must be abided
    by at all times by convention attendees and will be strictly enforced. All
    weapons and other props are subject to inspection by CPAC safety official at
    any time.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please consult the convention information desk or
    any other Safety official.</p>
